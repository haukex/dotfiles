Hauke's Notes for Alpine
========================

1. Change the colors to make the background transparent
   (may need to set color mode to "force-ansi-16color")

2. In the Config, set the option "User Domain" to a useful value
   if alpine complains on startup

3. In the Config, set the option "Pruning Rule" (near the bottom) to
   "don't rename, don't delete"
